# auto-setup

This project is just a bash script that ran with sudo installs everything I use on a Fedora Workstation machine, also including neovim and ghostty config files. 

Usage:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/tomaslobato/auto-setup
chmod +x ./setup.sh
./setup.sh #without sudo
```
<hr/>

Future considerations:
- debian/fedora switcher
