# auto-setup

This project is just a bash script that installs everything I use on a Fedora Workstation machine, also including neovim and tmux config files. 
Now compatible with Debian based too!

Usage:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/tomaslobato/auto-setup
chmod +x ./setup.sh
./setup.sh #without sudo
```
